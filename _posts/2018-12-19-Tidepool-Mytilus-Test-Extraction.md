#### Whole mussels stored in -80, took out one plastic bag with 5 mussels
#### Using Zymo Duet DNA RNA Extraction Kit [HERE](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/company-protocols/_d7003t_d7003_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf)

1. Thawed bag on ice bucket until mussels could be opened
2. Started with smallest mussel first then went through to the largest

|Sample|Location|Tide Pool|Date Collected|
|----|-----|-----|----|
|Mytilus 1|Bob Creek|TP5|8/13/2017|
|Mytilus 2|Bob Creek|TP5|8/13/2017|
|Mytilus 3|Bob Creek|TP5|8/13/2017|
|Mytilus 4|Bob Creek|TP5|8/13/2017|
|Mytilus 5|Bob Creek|TP5|8/13/2017|

3. RNase Zap lab bench, forceps and scissors
4. For each mussel, prepped 5 1.5mL tubes. 4 with 750μl DNA/RNA Shield and 1 with 300μl DNA/RNA Shield
5. Open one mussel at a time and take biopsies from:
    - mantle (take two)
    - gill
    - heart
    - abductor muscle
6. Put one mantle tissue in the 300μl tube and the others in the 750μl tubes.
7. The 750μl tubes were labeled, put in the fridge for 24 hours then frozen at -80
8. RNase Zap bench and sterilize tools between each mussel
9. Added 30μl PK Digestion Buffer to each extraction tube (mantle tubes with 300μl)
10. Added 15μl Proteinase K to each extraction tube
11. Vortexed and spun down tubes
12. Put in Thermomixer at 55 degrees C shaking 1200
13. Samples not fully digested after 5 hours, let go overnight
15. Took samples out at 9:07am, still not fully digested
16. Spun down in centrifuge at max rcf for 2 minutes
17. Removed supernatant and put into a new 1.5mL tube
19. Proceeded with DNA/RNA Extraction protocol

### DNA Extraction
30. Set up yellow DNA spin columns and collection tubes, label appropriately
31. Warm elution liquids to 70 degrees C (10mM Tris HCl pH. 8.0 and RNase free water)
32. Add equal volume (345µl) DNA/RNA lysis buffer to each sample tube
33. Finger flick to mix tubes
34. Add 700µl (total volume) of sample gently to the yellow DNA spin column
35. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
36. **Important** Save the flow through from this step: transfer to a new 1.5mL tube labeled for RNA
37. Add 400µl DNA/RNA Prep Buffer gently to the yellow DNA spin columns
38. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
39. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
40. Add 700µl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer gently to the yellow DNA spin columns
41. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
42. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
43. Add 400µl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer genetly to the yellow DNA spin columns
44. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for **2 minutes**
45. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
46. Transfer yellow columns to new 1.5mL microcentrifuge tubes
47. Add 50µl warmed 10mM Tris HCl to each yellow DNA column by dripping slowly directly on the filer
48. Incubate at room temp for 5 minutes
49. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
50. Repeat last three steps for a final elution volume of 100µl
51. Label tubes, store at 4 degrees C if quantifying the same day or the next, if waiting longer store in -20

### RNA Extraction
52. Add equal volume (700µl) 100% EtOH to the 1.5mL tubes labeled for RNA containing the original yellow column flow through
53. Vortex and spin down to mix
54. Add 700µl of that liquid to the green RNA spin columns
55. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
56. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
57. Add 700µl to the green RNA spin columns (the rest from the 1.5mL RNA tubes)
58. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
59. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
60. Add 400µl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer gently to each green RNA column
61. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
62. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
63. Make DNase I treatment master mix:
    - 75µl DNA Digestion buffer x # of samples
    - 5µl DNase I x # of samples
64. Add 80µl DNase I treatment master mix directly to the filter of the green RNA columns
65. Incubate at room temp for 15 minutes
66. Add 400µl DNA/RNA Prep Buffer gently to each column
67. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
68. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
69. Add 700µl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer gently to the yellow DNA spin columns
70. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
71. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
72. Add 400µl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer genetly to the yellow DNA spin columns
73. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for **2 minutes**
74. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
75. Transfer green columns to new 1.5mL microcentrifuge tubes
76. Add 50µl warmed DNase/RNase free water to each green RNA column by dripping slowly directly on the filer
77. Incubate at room temp for 5 minutes
78. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
79. Repeat last three steps for a final elution volume of 100µl
80. Label 1.5mL tubes on ice afterwards, and aliquot 5µl into PCR strip tubes to save for Qubit and Tape Station to avoid freeze-thaw of your stock sample
81. Store all tubes in the -80

### Qubit
- Using Broad Range dsDNA and Broad Range RNA kits
- Protocol [HERE](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)
- All quantifications are in ng/µl
- All quantifications were taken twice
