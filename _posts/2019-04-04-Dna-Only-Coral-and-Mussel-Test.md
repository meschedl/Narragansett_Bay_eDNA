title: Testing Quick-DNA Kit on Mo'orea Corals and Tide Pool Mytilus
tags: [ DNA, Mytilus, Porites, Pocillopora ]
---

### I was not able to get good RNA at this time from the Zymo DNa/RNA kit. We are moving forward with trying a DNA only kit on the samples to save $, time, and reagents. This was also tried with two _Mytilus californianus_ from the tide pool project that [did not have good RNA](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Tidepool-Mytilus-Test-Extraction/) with the other kit either.

#### Using this [kit](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/company-protocols/_d4068_d4069_quick-dna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf) with some protocol modifications to fit our samples. All samples were prepped with separating beads from the liquid by the sieve because it gave the best DNA quantity [last time](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Testing-Moorea-Samples-3/).

**Sample Prep:** steps before both processing followed the same protocol

Corals

| Sample # | Site # | Date Collected | Type |
|-----|-------|------|---|---|
| 157 | 4 | 2018/03/13 | _Pocillopora verrucosa_ |
| 157 | 4 | 2018/03/13 | _Pocillopora verrucosa_ |
| 266 | 4 | 2018/03/13 | Massive _Porites_|
| 268 | 4 | 2018/03/13 | Massive _Porites_ |

- Beads from [bead tubes](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/zr-bashing-bead-lysis-tubes/nc1099697#?keyword=zymo+bead) were poured into the sample tubes
- Samples were homogenized by vortexing for ~30 seconds. _Porites_ samples were homogenized for an extra ~20 seconds
- [Sieves/strainers](https://www.pluriselect.com/us/pluristrainer-mini-20-um-25-pack-sterile-in-bag.html) were placed in new labeled 1.5mL tubes
- About 1/3 of the sample was poured into the sieves and centrifuged **briefly** as the lid does not fit on the centrifuge
- The liquid sample went through into the tube but most of the beads stayed in the sieve
- Repeated pouring the rest of the sample into the sieve and centrifuging quickly
- After all the sample possible went through the sieve, the sieves with beads and any un-homogenized tissue were labeled with the sample number, parafilmed on the top, and saved in the -20
- About 450µl was in each tube
- Following recommendations for samples in DNA/RNA Shield from the kit protocol, 225µl of Solid Tissue Buffer and 15µl of Proteinase K were added to each sample
- Samples were votexed, spun down, and incubated at 55 degrees C for 5 hours shaking at 600rpm

Mussels

|Sample|Location|Tide Pool|Date Collected| Extraction type |
|----|-----|-----|----|
|Mytilus 6|Bob Creek|TP2|8/13/2017| normal volume |
|Mytilus 7|Bob Creek|TP2|8/13/2017| double volume |

- Thawed mussels on ice. They were still icy during dissection
- New foil was put down for each mussel
- Forceps were cleaned with 10% bleach and DI water before use. A new scalpel blade was used for each mussel
- Mussels were opened with the scalpel and a small chunk of mantle was taken and put into a 1.5mL tube  
- Mussels were given a number, put in a whirl pak, and returned to the -80
- The volumes in the kit protocol are very small (200µl) so for M7 I tried doubling those volumes to help get better recovery after bead homogenization
- Added 95µl of Nuclease free water and 95µl of Solid Tissue Buffer to M6
- Added 190µl of Nuclease free water and 190µl of Solid Tissue Buffer to M7
- Poured in [beads](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/zr-bashing-bead-lysis-tubes/nc1099697#?keyword=zymo+bead) and homogenized by vortexing for ~30 seconds
- Followed same steps as above with the sieve to collect the liquid
- Added 10µl Proteinase K to sample M6
- Added 20µl Proteinase K to sample M7
- Samples were votexed, spun down, and incubated at 55 degrees C for 5 hours shaking at 600rpm

**DNA Extraction**

1. Centrifuged all tubes at 12,000 rcf for 1 minute to pellet any debris and beads that got through the sieve
2. Removed supernatant into new 1.5mL tubes
3. Added 1 volume Genomic Binding Buffer to each tube, vortexed and spun down
  - Corals: 690µl
  - M6: 200µl
  - M7: 400µl
4. 700µl, or all for the mussels, of sample was added to the kit spin column and centrifuged at 12,000 rcf for 1 minute
5. Collection tubes were discarded
6. The rest of the coral samples were run through the column in the same way
7. Added 400µl DNA Pre-Wash Buffer, centrifuged at 12,000 rcf for 1 minute, and discarded the flow through
8. Added 700µl G-DNA Wash Buffer, centrifuged at 12,000 rcf for 1 minute, and discarded the flow through
9. Added 200µl G-DNA Wash Buffer, centrifuged at 12,000 rcf for 1 minute, and discarded the collection tube
10. Columns were transferred to 1.5mL tubes
11. Added 50µl warmed 70 degrees C 10mM Tris-HCl directly to the column filter and incubated at room temp for 5 minutes
12. Centrifuged for 1 minute at 12,000 rcf
13. Repeated steps 11 and 12 one more time
14. Sample tubes were labeled and stored in the 4 degree fridge to quantify the next day  

**Qubit**

- Broad Range dsDNA Qubit [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)
- DNA Qubit was preformed by Marygrace Trusdell
- All samples were read twice

| Sample | DNA Standard 1 (RFU) | DNA Standard 2 (RFU) | DNA 1 (ng/µl) | DNA 2 (ng/µl) | Average DNA |  
|------|----------|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| 157 | 203.63 | 22484 |102 | 100 | 101 |  
| 158 | 203.63 | 22484 | 178 | 178 | 178 |
| 266 | 203.63 | 22484 | 119 | 118 | 118.5 |
| 268 | 203.63 | 22484 | 84.2 | 83.4 | 83.6 |
| M6 | 203.63 | 22484 | 130 | 130 | 130 |
| M7 | 203.63 | 22484 | 128 | 127 | 127.5 |

These values are much higher than I have ever gotten out of the corals!!

**Gel**

- A 1.5% agarose gel was ran to check the integrity of the genomic DNA
- Following the PPP Lab [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Gel-Protocol/)
- The first 6 samples are from this extraction, the last 4 samples are from the [previous post](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Testing-Moorea-Samples-3/)
- Below the sample number is the amount of DNA in ng/µl from the Qubit

Mytilus DNA is not good quality here
