# Using ddRADSeqTools, the _Porites lutea_ genome, and the _Pocillopora damicornis_ genome to simulate PstI and MspI restriction enzyme fragment distributions

Downloaded [ddRADSeqTools](https://github.com/GGFHF/ddRADseqTools) from Github by clicking Clone or Download, and select Download Zip  
This Downloaded the repo to my computer, which is probably not the best way to do this, but it worked. I then copied it to my KITT account.

```
# in KITT made a directory to work in
mkdir sim-rad-frags
```
Have to use my terminal to copy things to KITT
```
scp -r -P zzzz /Users/maggieschedl/Desktop/ddRADseqTools-master.zip mschedl@kitt.uri.edu:/home/mschedl/sim-rad-frags
```
Then I unzipped it and made the scrips exicutable by using the commands they have in the [manual](https://github.com/GGFHF/ddRADseqTools/blob/master/Package/manual/ddRADseqTools-manual.pdf)
```
unzip ddRADseqTools-master.zip
cd ddRADseqTools-master/Package
chmod u+x *.py
conda install NumPy #also the manual says you need this program installed
```
Then download the two genomes  
[_Porites lutea_](http://plut.reefgenomics.org/)  
[_Pocillopora damicornis_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/22550)

```
scp -r -P zzzz /Users/maggieschedl/Desktop/porites_plut_final_2.1.fasta.gz mschedl@kitt.uri.edu:/home/mschedl/

scp -r -P zzzz /Users/maggieschedl/Desktop/poc_GCF_003704095.1_ASM370409v1_genomic.fna.gz mschedl@kitt.uri.edu:/home/mschedl/
```
Move them to storage then link them to the directory where the scripts are
```
mv porites_plut_final_2.1.fasta.gz /RAID_STORAGE2/mschedl/geenomes/

mv poc_GCF_003704095.1_ASM370409v1_genomic.fna.gz /RAID_STORAGE2/mschedl/geenomes/

cd sim-rad-frags/ddRADSeqTools-master/Package

ln -s /RAID_STORAGE2/mschedl/geenomes/* .
```
The program uses a text file with all the restriction enzymes and their cut sites as a reference, I went through the file and saw that they didn't have MspI so I added it in

```
nano restrictionsites.txt

MspI;C*CGG # add this in alphabetical order
```
Then the rsitesearch.py script uses the rsitesearch-config.txt to get all the information on what genome and enzymes to use. This is the only script I used, because it "extracts the fragments resulting from an _in silico_ digestion of a reference genome with two particular restriction endonucleases."

I edited the config file to do _Pocillopora_ first.
```
nano  rsitesearch-config.txt

genfile=./poc_GCF_003704095.1_ASM370409v1_genomic.fna.gz             # add in the pocillopora genome, the . because I linked it to this directory
fragsfile=./results/fragments.fasta         # path of the fragments file
rsfile=./restrictionsites.txt               # path of the restriction sites file
enzyme1=PstI                              # id of 1st restriction enzyme used in rsfile or its restriction site sequence
enzyme2=MspI                                # id of 2nd restriction enzyme used in rsfile or its restriction site sequence
minfragsize=150                             # lower boundary of loci fragment's size
maxfragsize=700                             # upper boundary of loci fragment's size
fragstfile=./results/fragments-stats.txt    # path of the output statistics file
fragstinterval=25                           # interval length of fragment size
plot=NO                                    # statistical graphs: YES or NO
verbose=YES                                 # additional job status info during the run: YES or NO
trace=NO                                    # additional info useful to the developer team: YES or NO
```

Then you have to make the results directory for some reason before it runs
```
mkdir results
```
Then run the script
```
python rsitesearch.py
```
**Output: 22679 fragments written**  
This means that there are 22679 fragments digested by both PstI and MspI in this _Pocillopora_ genome that are between 150 and 700bp long.

Change the name of the directory because doing two of these
```
mv results results-poc
```
The names of the files it gives you are  
fragments.fasta  fragments-GC-distribution.csv  poc-fragments-stats.csv  poc-fragments-stats.txt

Copy the results to my computer to run them on R. I had to change the CSV file format in excel to make the figure in R
```
scp -r -P zzzz mschedl@kitt.uri.edu:/home/mschedl/sim-rad-frags/ddRADseqTools-master/Package/results/* /Users/maggieschedl/Desktop/URI/Maggie/PutnamPuritzMoorea

```

The CSV file doesn't go into excel well, the columns are separated by ; instead of commas. I changed the fragments-stats.csv to a .txt by renaming it (it gives an error but do it anyways), then in excel in the Data tab, import from text and use that file. Follow the GUI and say that the fields are delimitated, then specify ; as the symbol. After that it makes a column for each field. But, the fragment interval values 1-25, 26-50 etc are not continuous, so those don't work for the graph I wanted. So I created a new column to the right of the interval column to split it. Select the interval column and click text to column in the data tab. Again say delaminated and this time by - this should make two columns and I named them fragment_interval_start and fragment_interval_end. This way I could make another column mean_locus_size that was the average of those two columns. There's probably a way to do this in R but ü§∑üèª‚Äç


Then I did the same thing for the _Porites_

```
nano  rsitesearch-config.txt

genfile=./porites_plut_final_2.1.fasta.gz             # file of the reference genome in fasta format
fragsfile=./results/fragments.fasta         # path of the fragments file
rsfile=./restrictionsites.txt               # path of the restriction sites file
enzyme1=PstI                              # id of 1st restriction enzyme used in rsfile or its restriction site sequence
enzyme2=MspI                                # id of 2nd restriction enzyme used in rsfile or its restriction site sequence
minfragsize=150                             # lower boundary of loci fragment's size
maxfragsize=700                             # upper boundary of loci fragment's size
fragstfile=./results/por-fragments-stats.txt    # path of the output statistics file
fragstinterval=25                           # interval length of fragment size
plot=NO                                    # statistical graphs: YES or NO
verbose=YES                                 # additional job status info during the run: YES or NO
trace=NO                                    # additional info useful to the developer team: YES or NO
```
Saved and ran the script
```
mkdir results
python rsitesearch.py
mv results results-por
```
**Output: 70510 fragments written**  
This means that there are 70510 fragments digested by both PstI and MspI in this _Porites_ genome that are between 150 and 700bp long.

Then copied to my computer
```
scp -r -P zzzz mschedl@kitt.uri.edu:/home/mschedl/sim-rad-frags/ddRADseqTools-master/Package/results-por/* /Users/maggieschedl/Desktop/URI/Maggie/PutnamPuritzMoorea
```
Changed the csv file in the same way and renamed it for _Porites_


### Using R to Make Figures of the Fragment Distributions

Load Packages
```{r}
getwd()
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```
Read the edited CSV files from ddRADSeqTools output
```{r}
pocillopora_RAD_stats <- read.csv("POC-PstI-MspI-RAD-frags.csv")

porites_RAD_stat <- read.csv("POR-PstI-MspI-frags.csv")
```

**Pocilliopora Fragments**   
Using mutate highlights the region between 150-700bp, then I also set the cut off of the x axis to be 5000, we aren't looking that high anyways.  
```{r}
pocillopora_RAD_stats %>%
mutate(highlight_flag = ifelse(mean_loci_size > 150 & mean_loci_size < 700, T, F)) %>%
ggplot(aes(x=mean_loci_size, y=num_frags))+
geom_bar(aes(fill= highlight_flag), stat="identity") +
theme_bw(base_size=18) + scale_fill_manual(values = c('#58a2d3', '#b2e58e'))  + theme(legend.position = "none") + xlab("Mean Locus Size") + ylab("Number of Loci") + xlim(0, 5000)

ggsave("pocillopora150-700frag.jpg", height=7, width=10, units="in", dpi=600)

```

**Porites Fragments**

```{r}
porites_RAD_stat %>%
mutate(highlight_flag = ifelse(mean_loci_size > 150 & mean_loci_size < 700, T, F)) %>%
ggplot(aes(x=mean_loci_size, y=num_frags))+
geom_bar(aes(fill= highlight_flag), stat="identity") +
theme_bw(base_size=18) + xlim(0, 5000) + scale_fill_manual(values = c('#58a2d3', '#b2e58e')) + theme(legend.position = "none") + xlab("Mean Locus Size") + ylab("Number of Loci")

ggsave("porites150-700frag.jpg", height=7, width=10, units="in", dpi=600)
```
