# 12 Tests of Individual and Double Enzymes for Both Species

Two DNA samples of each _Pocillopora_ and _Porites_ were chosen that have high concentrations to use for the tests.   
For each sample the following digestions were prepared:  
- Single digest with [PstI](https://www.neb.com/products/r0140-psti#Product%20Information)
- Single digest with [MspI](https://www.neb.com/products/r0106-mspi#Product%20Information)

For one sample of each species the following double digestions were prepared:
- Double digest with [PstI](https://www.neb.com/products/r0140-psti#Product%20Information) and [MspI](https://www.neb.com/products/r0106-mspi#Product%20Information)
- Double digest with [PstI](https://www.neb.com/products/r0140-psti#Product%20Information) and [HpaII](https://www.neb.com/products/r0171-hpaii#Product%20Information)

**Master Mixes of the enzymes and buffers were made for each digestion**

Master Mix 1 (MM1)
- 10µl Cutsmart buffer * 4.2 = 42µl
- 1µl PstI * 4.2 = 4.2µl

Master Mix 2 (MM2)
- 10µl Cutsmart buffer * 4.2 = 42µl
- 1µl MspI * 4.2 = 4.2µl

Master Mix 3 (MM3)
- 10µl Cutsmart buffer * 2.1 = 21µl
- 1µl PstI * 2.1 = 2.1µl
- 1µl MspI * 2.1 = 2.1µl

Master Mix 4 (MM4)
- 10µl Cutsmart buffer * 2.1 = 21µl
- 1µl PstI * 2.1 = 2.1µl
- 1µl HpaII * 2.1 = 2.1µl

All digestions were done in .2mL strip tubes, and samples were diluted to 500ng in 88µl 10mM Tris HCl to add up to 100µl digestion volume with the addition of the master mix.

|E2|_Porites_ 268 PstI & HpaII|5.98|82.02|12µl MM4|

Everything was pipetted repeatedly and gently to mix   
Tubes were spun down, and put into a PCR program for 37 degrees C for 12 hours and a hold at 4 degrees C

Our TapeStation is down so we used the Bioanalyzer in the [GSC](https://web.uri.edu/gsc/agilent-2100-bioanalyzer-2/) to look at the fragment size distributions from the digestions  
A High Sensitivity DNA Assay was ran with 1µl of DNA from all of the digestions but SP4 (there are only 11 spots on the chip)

It looks like the upper marker gets off starting at lane 4, so it is hard to tell what the fragment distribution really is. The full pdf of of the Bioanalyzer output is [here](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/tapestation_pdfs/2100%20expert_High%20Sensitivity%20DNA%20Assay_DE72901048_2019-05-02_14-32-03.pdf)

A 1.5% gel was also run on the samples to get a better look at them using [this protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Gel-Protocol/)
