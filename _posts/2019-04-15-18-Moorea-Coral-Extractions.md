# 18 DNA only extractions from _Porites_ and _Pocillopora_ Corals from Mo'orea

#### Using the Zymo Quick-DNA Miniprep Plus [kit](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/company-protocols/_d4068_d4069_quick-dna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf)

- New [Beads](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/disruption-beads-0-5mm-yeast-1/50212143?searchHijack=true&searchTerm=50212143&searchType=RAPID&matchedCatNo=50212143) were poured into sample tubes. The new beads should be easier to pipette the liquid out of them as the do not get sucked up by the p20
- Samples were homogenized by vortexing for ~30 seconds for all samples
- Most of the liquid from the tubes was removed by pipetting. This was about 300µl. The tubes contained a small amount of liquid and un-homogenized tissue left, so 200µl of DNA/RNA shield was added to each tube and those were put back into the -20
- Following recommendations for samples in DNA/RNA Shield from the kit protocol, 150µl of Solid Tissue Buffer and 10µl of Proteinase K were added to each sample
- Samples were votexed, spun down, and incubated at 55 degrees C for 5 hours shaking at 600rpm

**DNA Extraction**

1. Centrifuged all tubes at 12,000 rcf for 1 minute to pellet any debris and beads that got through the sieve
2. Removed supernatant into new 1.5mL tubes
3.  Added 1 volume (420µl) Genomic Binding Buffer to each tube, vortexed and spun down
4. 700µl of sample was added to the kit spin column and centrifuged at 12,000 rcf for 1 minute
5. Collection tubes were discarded
6. The rest of the coral samples were run through the column in the same way
7. Added 400µl DNA Pre-Wash Buffer, centrifuged at 12,000 rcf for 1 minute, and discarded the flow through
8. Added 700µl G-DNA Wash Buffer, centrifuged at 12,000 rcf for 1 minute, and discarded the flow through
9. Added 200µl G-DNA Wash Buffer, centrifuged at 12,000 rcf for 1 minute, and discarded the collection tube
10. Columns were transferred to 1.5mL tubes
11. Added 50µl warmed 70 degrees C 10mM Tris-HCl directly to the column filter and incubated at room temp for 5 minutes
12. Centrifuged for 1 minute at 12,000 rcf
13. Repeated steps 11 and 12 one more time
14. Stored tubes in fridge to qubit the next immediately

**Qubit**

- Broad Range dsDNA Qubit [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)
- Qubit was performed by Marygrace Trusdell
- All samples were read twice

**Gel Verification**

- A 1.5% agarose gel was ran to check the integrity of the genomic DNA
- Following the PPP Lab [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Gel-Protocol/)
- Gel was run by Marygrace Trusdell
- Two samples are from Kevin Wong's Astrangia homogenates

![gel]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/gel-04-16-19.jpg "gel")

Samples 67, 220, and 338 don't look like they are very good quality. I am going to try to re-extract from 67 and 220 because those are quite low. I should also try 338. This gel was run on the 18th, which is after I started the next extraction.
